# nbtviewer
Simple cli tool for parsing and printing the contents of Minecraft Java NBT files (both gzipped and uncompressed).

It's more of an excercise for me rather than an actual project.

Works only with JAVA edition of MC and requires zlib in PATH.

Will add editing ability and proper memory management soonâ„¢
